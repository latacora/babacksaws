  "Like [[aws/invoke]], but with pagination. Returns a lazy seq of results.

  You likely don't need to specify your own pagination behavior: if you don't,
  we'll try to infer some reasonable defaults. Pagination opts are as follows:

  `:results` is a fn from a response to the actual objects, e.g. :Accounts
  or (comp :Instances :Reservation). Note that because we're returning a lazy
  seq of results, we can only collect one thing at a time. Some operations, e.g.
  s3's ListObjectVersions, have two: DeletionMarkers and Versions. By default,
  these get intermingled via concatenation.

  `:truncated?` is a fn that given a response, tells you if there's another one
  or not. For some services, this is :IsTruncated (hence the name), but it is
  often based on the existence of next marker keys in the previous response.

  `:next-request` takes the last request (part of the op-map) and last response
  and returns the next request."
